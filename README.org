=ase-ddec-vasp= is an extension module for ase.calculators.vasp

This module adds on functionality ase.calculators.Vasp to allow one to run the DDEC program through Vasp.get_charges() function.


1) Be able to submit a MATLAB batch job to the queue to calculate charges.
2) Recognize when a job needs to be submitted -- similar to the functionality of jasp.
3) Read the charges from the ddec output file.
4) When calling atoms.get_charges() again and it already contains charges, be able to see if the current charges matches the atoms.charges

To use this module, do either one of two things. Alter the ase-ddec-jasp file to include the directory where the chargemol_10_10-2012 in both the PYTHON_PATH and DDEC_PATH variables. Or, addd these two lines to your .bashrc file.

export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/this/folder:$PYTHONPATH
export DDEC_PATH=/path/folder/that/has/chargemol_10_10_2012
