ase-ddec-vasp is an extension module for both ase.calculators.vasp and the ase.Atoms object. Originally, charges was just a list of arrays for the Atoms object that one manually assigned and coule manually read. The only two functionalities for charges was through the atoms.set_charges and atoms.get_charges, where atoms.get_charges just reads the charges you had to either initialize the Atoms object with or set with atoms.set_charges. As far as I can tell, there is no way to actually calculate theoretical net atomic charges (NAC) of systems.

This module adds on functionality both ase.atoms and ase.calculators. They main idea is that atoms.get_charges() actually does calculations if it is attached to a vasp calculator that has been monkeypatched through jasp. Some things atoms.get_charges(). atoms.get_charges() should eventually do these things.

1) Recognize if the atoms object is attached to a jasp calculator object.
2) Be able to submit a matlab batch job to the queue to calculate charges.
3) Recognize when a job needs to be submitted, similar to the functionality of jasp.
4) Read the charges from the ddec output file.
5) When calling atoms.get_charges() again and it already contains charges, be able to see if the current charges matches the atoms.charges
